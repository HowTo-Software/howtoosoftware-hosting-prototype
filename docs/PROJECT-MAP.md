Use this map to find where behavior is implemented. [Architecture](phase-2-design/architecture.md) explains the relationships; the [index](README.md) organizes the guides.

## Structure

```text

  Components/        Razor pages, composition, and controls
  Models/            products, quotes, orders, and commerce entities
  Services/          application rules, content, purchases, and delivery
  Infrastructure/    configuration, SQL, security, Stripe, and Pterodactyl
  Data/              EF contexts, migrations, factories, and seed

## Text families

CommonText, HomeText, LoginText, HardwareText, CheckoutText, and StorefrontText have neutral EN resources and PT-BR counterparts. New visible feature copy belongs in the appropriate family and must preserve formatting placeholders in both languages.

## References and evidence

`docs/reference-sources` retains the collected public Skiper originals, which are not part of runtime. Supplied OriginKit code was adapted inside the application without publishing the attachment as a UI kit. `docs/frontend` contains screenshots and QA JSON, including historical versions identified in the guide.

The [test plan](phase-4-testing/test-plan.md) locates risk-based validation. Private configuration is excluded from this map; use setting names from the example, never real `.env` content.
