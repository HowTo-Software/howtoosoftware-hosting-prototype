## Preserved specialist guides

[FRONTEND-REDESIGN.md](FRONTEND-REDESIGN.md), [COMMERCE-ARCHITECTURE.md](COMMERCE-ARCHITECTURE.md), [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md), [SQLSERVER-SETUP.md](SQLSERVER-SETUP.md), [PTERODACTYL-SETUP.md](PTERODACTYL-SETUP.md), and [stripe-testing.md](stripe-testing.md) retain their existing paths. Phase documents link to these guides when the procedure already exists.

## Interpreting document status

**Checked against the local code** means that behavior was compared with files in this working tree. It does not imply formal team approval or verification of external infrastructure.

**Operational procedure** describes how to perform a task; applying it on the server depends on the real configuration. **Proposal without a schedule** identifies desired work without a delivery commitment. Historical evidence retains its execution date and environment.

The working branch is `feat/hosting-frontend-redesign`, based on `main` at `a7ac383`. Documented local changes may not have been published yet. The [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) uses “Unreleased” for this work.

Maintain all project documentation in **English**, following the [adopted standard](documentation-standard.md). These guides describe **HTS Hosting**, which is separate from the other HTS website creation and maintenance project.

## Automatic game trials

[Trial servers](TRIAL-SERVERS.md) documents email verification, the shared 24-hour policy, SQL claims, Pterodactyl suspension, 72-hour save retention, Minecraft selectors and conversion through the existing checkout.

[Public promotions](PUBLIC-PROMOTIONS.md) explains opt-in announcements of existing coupons, validation, limits and checkout links.
