This changelog records the current state and known local work. No release tag has been assigned to the redesign in this document.

## Unreleased — visual redesign and documentation

### Frontend

- New storefront hierarchy: game → plan → review → payment, with links generated from existing routes.
- Graphite, paper, and cobalt palette; light/dark themes; improved navigation, comparison, review, and infrastructure presentation.
- Large HTS wordmark centered at the beginning above the heading; removed the large configurator and homepage panel demonstration.
- Compact infrastructure page with real photos, a single specification sheet and native operational disclosures.
- Trial entry prioritised on the homepage; conditional announcements for explicitly approved database promotion codes.
- HTS Vector Wordmark adapted from the supplied OriginKit code, using WebGL with pausing, drawing limits, and a static fallback.
- Skiper UI CssLink and TextRoll adaptations, with collected sources and preserved attribution.
- CSS masks and updates that preserve Blazor's node tree during navigation.
- Reduced-motion and no-JavaScript support, with responsive refinements.
- Storefront copy in EN/PT-BR, maintaining parity across updated resource families.

### Automatic trial lifecycle

- Added SQL-backed, email-verified trials shared across Project Zomboid and Minecraft: one per account, 24 hours from installation completion, then suspension and 72-hour save retention.
- Defaults: CPU 0, RAM 6144 MiB and disk 25600 MiB; operator configuration governs approved Minecraft editions, variants, versions and eggs.
- Added SMTP notifications, owner access recovery, durable lifecycle leases, retries and paid-order associations.
- Checkout conversion updates and resumes the same server. Expired reservations retain order history, preventing late payments from creating a second server.
- Added an unapplied commerce migration and environment examples; no production database or server was changed.
- Minecraft paid tiers remain configuration-driven, with no invented commercial prices.

### Documentation

- Rewritten README distinguishing features, integrations, demonstrations, and outstanding work.
- Six-phase index inspired by `best-document`, covering architecture, requirements, development, QA, deployment, and operations.
- Data model, HTTP contracts, ADRs, user guides, and file map.
- Corrected outdated descriptions of plans, prices, animations, the lab, and production state.
- Existing technical guides retained as references and linked from the new index.
- English applied throughout the generated and revised documentation, including metadata, diagrams, and link labels; English established as the maintenance language.

### Visual review evidence

Before publication, incorporated the latest `main` dependency updates at `277e7b1` and repeated Release build/test validation. Updated repository presentation and current v3 screenshots, documented local `.env` placement, excluded env files from Docker context, and corrected the operations guide to reflect minute-based order recovery.

NuGet checks reported no outdated direct packages and no vulnerable packages, including transitive dependencies, in the current feed. Internal dependency upgrades were not forced beyond the versions selected by their parent SDKs.

On 2026-10-05: Release compilation without warnings/errors, 627 passing tests, and 77 Chromium checks in an isolated local environment. Current screenshots and reports capture the centered opening wordmark and compact infrastructure. See the [detailed record](docs/FRONTEND-REDESIGN.md) for scenarios and limitations.

## Previous main baseline

The local redesign baseline is `a7ac383`: the deployment directory moved to `/opt/howtoosoftware-hosting-prototype`. That baseline already contains Stripe checkout, SQL Server persistence, Pterodactyl provisioning, and the deployment pipeline; these features are not presented as part of a new visual release.

Commit history is the source for authorship and change order: use `git log`. When releasing a version, add its tag/commit, changes, and actual validation using the [release notes guide](docs/phase-5-deployment/release-notes-template.md).
